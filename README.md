# currency-recognition-system-using-image-processing
The project presents an **automatic currency recognition system** that uses **digital image processing techniques** to identify currency notes based on their images or photographs. The system helps users recognize key details about the currency, such as its value, name, and equivalent amounts in **INR**, **EURO**, and **USD**. It works by analyzing the characteristics of currency notes, such as size, color, and printed text, and is designed to handle variations within the same currency. The system focuses on **Indian Rupees** and **US Dollars**, two widely used currencies, and demonstrates high accuracy and speed in identifying notes.

The process involves several steps: **image acquisition**, **preprocessing**, **feature extraction**, and **classification**. Machine learning techniques, including **neural networks**, **support vector machines**, and **decision trees**, are employed to classify different denominations. Additionally, the system detects counterfeit currency by identifying anomalies in the patterns and features of the notes, enhancing security in financial transactions.
